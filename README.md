## 📂 Problem Structure

Each problem typically contains:
```
Problem-Name/
├── main.cpp              # Solution code
├── Problem-Name.cbp      # Code::Blocks project file
├── Problem-Name.layout   # Code::Blocks layout settings
├── bin/                  # Compiled binaries
└── obj/                  # Object files
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (g++, MinGW, etc.)
- Code::Blocks IDE (optional, for project files)

### Running Solutions

1. **Using g++ directly:**
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -Wall main.cpp -o solution
./solution
```

2. **Using Code::Blocks:**
   - Open the `.cbp` project file
   - Build and run (F9)

3. **Input/Output:**
   - Most solutions read from standard input (stdin)
   - Output to standard output (stdout)
   - Test with provided test cases or custom inputs

## 📊 Progress Tracker

- **CSES Problems:** 56+ problems solved
- **Codeforces Problems:** 118+ problems solved
- **Topic-wise Practice:** 70+ categorized problems
